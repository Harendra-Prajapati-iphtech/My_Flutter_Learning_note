#  Widgets are the elements from which you build every Flutter app.
#   As you can see, even the app itself is a widget.
Ex. 1.StatelessWidget
    2.StatefulWidget

 class myApp (){ #the starting point of your app.

 } 
 MyAppState # defines state of your app
 MyAppState # defines the data the app needs to function. Right now, it only contains a single variable with the current random word pair. You will add to this later.
 ChangeNotifier  # way to manage app state in flutter. also maney powefull ways are avialable.
                 # The state class extends ChangeNotifier which means that it can notify others about its own changes.

# Every widget defines a build() method that's automatically called every time the widget's circumstances change so that the widget is always up to date.
# MyHomePage tracks changes to the app's current state using the watch method.

Scaffold () :  # it's a helpful widget and is found in the vast majority of real-world Flutter apps.
Column () :   # is one of the most basic layout widgets in Flutter.

WordPair # provides several helpful getters, such as asPascalCase or asSnakeCase. Here, we use asLowerCase
